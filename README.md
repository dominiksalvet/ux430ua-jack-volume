# ASUS ZenBook UX430UA Jack Volume Setup

In the default setup of the ASUS ZenBook UX430UA running Linux, output volume of 3.5 mm jack audio often has a low coefficient, so audio volume of 3.5 mm devices is scaled down signigicantly compared to what it should be. The problem occurs with some delay after plugging-in 3.5 mm device. So even despite of adjusting sound volume level on the 3.5 mm device, if possible, after plugging-in this 3.5 mm device, sound volume is very high for a while and then jumps to the expected level, which may be very unpleasant.

The described problem can be solved with this program. The program includes a smart makefile for easier installation.
